ltumm,@kaitlynmwinner  just missed her lol
rawmontage,"@laurenbushnell Did you know that all 3 of those sunscreens have multiple active ingredients that are endocrine distributors and can mess up your hormones?Just a few ingredients to look out for when buying sunscreens: Oxybenzone, Octinoxate, Homosalate, Octisalate, Fragrance with phthalates,(these all are endocrine disrupters and can mess with your hormones), and Retinal Palminate (type of vitamin A, that can increase the risk of tumors and lesions when applied to skin and combined with sun exposure). Neutrogena does offer a few sunscreens however, that have fewer toxins. For example:- Sheer Zinc Dry Touch Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 & 50 - Pure & Free Baby Sunscreen SPF 50Just a few thoughts! Thought I would share 💕"
